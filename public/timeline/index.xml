<p>In 2011 Bryant founded <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com/">Black Girls Code</a> after her daughter, Kai, attended a computer science summer camp where she was the only Black person in an almost exclusively white male space. Bryant described this as a &ldquo;turning point&rdquo;. &ldquo;I wanted to create something where she could find another community of girls like her who were interested in technology,&rdquo; she said.<sup><a href="https://www.hostingadvice.com/blog/black-girls-code-inspires-young-women-of-color/">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>Since then, BGC has reached over 20,000 students and expanded to 15 chapters across the U.S. and South Africa. Their goal is to teach 1 million girls to code by 2040.</p>
<p>Bryant has received many accolades for her work with BGC. In 2013, the White House honored Bryant as a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/08/08/honoring-tech-inclusion-champions-change-white-house">Champion of Change for Tech Inclusion</a>. Bryant received Smithsonian Magazine&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/ingenuity/ceremonies/2014-winners/">American Ingenuity Award</a> for Social Progress in 2014 and won the POLITICO <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/2014-women-who-rule-award-winners-announced-113268">Women Who Rule</a> Award. In 2019, she was inducted into the SXSW Interactive Festival <a href="https://www.sxsw.com/interactive/2019/announcing-the-2019-sxsw-interactive-innovation-awards-finalists-and-hall-of-fame-inductee-kimberly-bryant/">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

            <description>Rediet Abebe is an Ethiopian computer scientist working in algorithms and artificial intelligence. She is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley and a Junior Fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows.[1]
On Dr. Abebe&amp;rsquo;s website, she describes her research interests:
 My research broadly falls in the fields of algorithms and AI, with a focus on equity and justice concerns. My work has provided new mathematical and computational frameworks for problems related to poverty and inequality.</description>

<p>On Dr. Abebe&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/">website</a>, she describes her research interests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My research broadly falls in the fields of algorithms and AI, with a focus on equity and justice concerns. My work has provided new mathematical and computational frameworks for problems related to poverty and inequality. Specifically, I design and analyze algorithmic, optimization, and network-based techniques to improve access to opportunity for historically under-served and disadvantaged communities. I also work on human-centered approaches to mechanism design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abebe has received multiple honors in the past few years. In 2019, Abebe was named one of <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2019/">35 Innovators Under 35</a> by the MIT Technology Review. In 2020, Abebe received the <a href="https://www.kdd.org/awards/sigkdd-dissertation-award">ACM SIGKDD Dissertation Award</a>.</p>

            <description>Black history still matters after Black History Month in February. I encourage people to keep learning about the important contributions Black people have made to the world. Unfortunately for some, the focus on the past may lead to ignoring the present realities of systemic racism and social injustices.
As we acknowledge the past, we can also recognize Black history in the making. I want to dedicate this coming month to today&amp;rsquo;s Black pioneers who march on toward creating a brighter future for all people.</description>

I encourage people to keep learning about the important contributions Black people have made to the world. Unfortunately for some, the focus on the past may lead to ignoring the present realities of systemic racism and social injustices.</p>
<p>As we acknowledge the past, we can also recognize <strong>Black history in the making</strong>. I want to dedicate this coming month to today&rsquo;s Black pioneers who march on toward creating a brighter future for all people. I am a software developer, so I wanted to highlight Black people in STEAM disciplines that I find inspiring and offer ways to help future Black innovators.</p>
<p>We must support Black people, especially in terms of education and career opportunities. <em>The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education</em> reported on the National Science Foundation&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.jbhe.com/2021/01/academic-disciplines-where-african-americans-received-few-or-no-doctorates-in-2019/"><em>Survey of Earned Doctorates</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>African Americans earned only one percent of all doctorates awarded in physics to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Blacks earned 3.2 percent of all mathematics and statistics doctorates, 3.4 percent of all doctorates in computer science, 3.5 percent of all doctorates in chemistry, and only 4.2 percent of all doctorates awarded in engineering disciplines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sobering facts should not dim our hopes, but rather encourage us to rectify such persistent inequalities. The profiles and organizations I will cover this month are doing just that and need your help. Let&rsquo;s March On Together!</p>
