## Organizations

In 2011 Bryant founded [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/) after her daughter, Kai, attended a computer science summer camp where she was the only Black person in an almost exclusively white male space. Bryant described this as a "turning point". "I wanted to create something where she could find another community of girls like her who were interested in technology," she said.<sup>[\[2\]](https://www.hostingadvice.com/blog/black-girls-code-inspires-young-women-of-color/)</sup>

Since then, BGC has reached over 20,000 students and expanded to 15 chapters across the U.S. and South Africa. Their goal is to teach 1 million girls to code by 2040.

Bryant has received many accolades for her work with BGC. In 2013, the White House honored Bryant as a [Champion of Change for Tech Inclusion](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2013/08/08/honoring-tech-inclusion-champions-change-white-house). Bryant received Smithsonian Magazine's [American Ingenuity Award](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/ingenuity/ceremonies/2014-winners/) for Social Progress in 2014 and won the POLITICO [Women Who Rule](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/2014-women-who-rule-award-winners-announced-113268) Award. In 2019, she was inducted into the SXSW Interactive Festival [Hall of Fame](https://www.sxsw.com/interactive/2019/announcing-the-2019-sxsw-interactive-innovation-awards-finalists-and-hall-of-fame-inductee-kimberly-bryant/).
