[Dr. Jessica Esquivel](https://www.jessicaesquivelphd.com/) is a particle physicist born and raised in Texas. After earning her PhD in physics from Syracuse University, she began postdoc work at Fermilab. She is also a [AAAS If/Then](https://www.ifthenshecan.org/) Ambassador, a member of the [Change – Now Collective](https://changenowphysics.com/), a science communicator, and a vocal advocate for increasing equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM.

Esquivel faced numerous difficulties navigating academic spaces where she felt ostracized and ignored. "It’s hard to separate your microaggressions when you deal with intersecting minoritized identities," Esquivel said. "Was it because I was the only woman? The only Black person? The only Mexican? The only lesbian? My coping mechanism is to try to forget the aggressions."

Esquivel attributes her success to her stubborn nature. When she learned that only 60 to 65 Black women had ever earned a physics PhD in the US, she knew that she had to "\[forge\] a path for other people". The support of a couple professors, meeting with [Dr. Jedidah Isler](http://jedidahislerphd.com/), and building a community with other minoritized individuals got her through graduate school.

Dr. Esquivel's current research combines machine learning with particle physics:
>We are tasked with studying the building blocks of the universe with the biggest detectors in the country. Currently, I'm on the Muon g-2 experiment, where we are using a particle called the muon to probe into possible new physics. Muons are similar to electrons but heavier, they spin like a spinning top in a magnetic field, which is called the g factor. We fill a huge magnet with muons and watch them dance in the magnetic field. We also know that a quantum foam exists in empty space that acts similar to fizz from soda. As the bubbles in fizz zoom up to the top and pop, so do virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in vacuum. Our theory of particle physics, colloquially called the standard model, has a pretty good idea of which virtual particles pop in and out, but by paying very close attention to these muons' choreography we can see if a new particle pops into existence by watching for a new dance move.

## Organizations

Dr. Esquivel is a co-founder and lead organizer of 
[Black In Physics](https://www.blackinphysics.org/), a grassroots movement and online community created in the wake of 2020′s social unrest; it centers on uplifting Black voices and celebrating contributions of those in the physics field. Esquivel says that when she’s not sifting through massive amounts of data or trying to answer questions that haven’t been asked before, she’s all about community engagement and mentorship of Black and brown girls.

During the last week of February, Black In Physics held a [Wikipedia Edit-a-thon](https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Black_in_Physics/Black_in_Physics_Edit-a-thon_(2021-02-21)/home) to create articles for Black physicists that had previously gone unrecognized.

Esquivel helped form the  [ChangeNow](https://changenowphysics.com/) collective at Fermilab last June. Their work is promising, but much remains to be done. "The lab has a new equity, diversity, and inclusion director, a position that our collective had a role in creating. The lab promoted a Black woman postdoc to associate scientist. We want to make a cultural shift in physics, and we have laid out [seven strategic goals](https://changenowphysics.com/strategic-plan). They include hiring Black scientists, restructuring leadership and decision-making entities, and investing in Black communities." 

As an If/Then ambassador, Esquivel inspires girls to participate in STEM careers.
