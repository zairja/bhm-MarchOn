[Dr. Kyla McMullen](http://kylamcmullen.com/) earned her bachelor's degree in computer science from the University of Maryland, then went on to complete a master's and Ph.D. in computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. While earning her Ph.D. she was also a faculty member at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan where she taught computer literacy courses to over 2,000 students. Dr. McMullen is the first (and currently the only) woman of color to earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Michigan. She is now a tenure-track faculty member in the University of Florida’s Computer & Information Sciences & Engineering Department. Dr. McMullen has a personal commitment to encouraging women and minorities to pursue careers in computing and other STEM fields.

Dr. McMullen's research interests are in the perception, applications, and development of 3D audio technologies. She is using this research to create realistic virtual environments, enhance data sonification, augment assistive technologies for persons with visual impairments, and decrease cognitive load in multimodal systems. Dr. McMullen is at work on multiple projects, including:
>3D Audio Rescue, which enables you to put on headphones and create 3D audio sound tokens that are used in virtual and augmented environments when you can’t use visual cues. One example would be using the temperature from a heat gun and turning the information into 3d audio cues to help first responders locate a human in a smoky fire. The system has been built and is being tested by the Jamesville Fire Department.<sup>[\[1\]](https://cmd-it.org/news-recent/kyla-mcmullen-assistant-professor-university-of-florida/)</sup>

Among McMullen's latest published research is work involving brain-computer interfaces that translate emotions into music, which could be used for rehabilitation and music therapy, as well as a novel method for musical expression. She has recently earned the National Science Foundation’s CAREER Award to further support her research in auditory user interfaces and assistive technology. She is also the PI of an NSF S-STEM award to augment the financial load of graduate school for PhD students.

## Organizations

Dr. McMullen is also senior personnel for NSF’s [Institute for African-American Mentoring in Computing Sciences](http://iaamcs.org/) (iAAMCS) effort to broaden participation in the field of computing. In this role, she has served as the conference chair for the [National Society of Blacks in Computing](http://nsbc.org/). The conference gathers Black computing student, faculty, and industry professionals for professional development, career progress, networking, and bonding. In addition, Dr. McMullen  co-hosts [Modern Figures Podcast](http://modernfigurespodcast.com/), elevating the voices of Black women in computing. This podcast is a collaborative effort with iAAMCS and The National Center for Women and Information Technology to highlight the often neglected stories of Black women in computing.

Dr. McMullen was a keynote speaker at the 2020 CMD-IT/ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference. The mission of [Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in IT](https://cmd-it.org/) is to "ensure that under-represented groups are fully engaged in computing and information technologies, and to promote innovation that enriches, enhances, and enables these communities, such that more equitable and sustainable contributions are possible by all communities." 

## Ways to Contribute

The [Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities in IT](https://cmd-it.org/) (CMD-IT) accepts [donations](https://cmd-it.org/donate/). Additionally, Dr. McMullen was a [Meyerhoff Scholar](https://meyerhoff.umbc.edu/how-to-give/), a program through UMBC that produces the most Black Ph.D./M.D. students in the US.
