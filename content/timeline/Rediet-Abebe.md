On Dr. Abebe's [website](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~red/), she describes her research interests:
>My research broadly falls in the fields of algorithms and AI, with a focus on equity and justice concerns. My work has provided new mathematical and computational frameworks for problems related to poverty and inequality. Specifically, I design and analyze algorithmic, optimization, and network-based techniques to improve access to opportunity for historically under-served and disadvantaged communities. I also work on human-centered approaches to mechanism design.

Abebe has received multiple honors in the past few years. In 2019, Abebe was named one of [35 Innovators Under 35](https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2019/) by the MIT Technology Review. In 2020, Abebe received the [ACM SIGKDD Dissertation Award](https://www.kdd.org/awards/sigkdd-dissertation-award).

## Organizations
