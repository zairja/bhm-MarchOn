[Alexis Williams](http://alexisdenisew.com/index.html) is a 20-year-old creative and engineering student at the Tandon School of Engineering at New York University. She is an Integrated Digital Media major concentrating in Computer Science and Web Development with an interest in sound engineering. Alexis is the creator of [pb-resources.com](pb-resources.com), a site brimming with anti-racism resources and direct action. Her site went viral in 2020 after she made a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@lelegenevieve/video/6838434358647377157) about it.

In addition to coding up an [email generator](https://www.pb-resources.com/emails.html) for petitions, Alexis's site features a [Black Lives Matter cheat sheet](https://www.pb-resources.com/cheatSheet.html), an incredible [Black History Month](https://www.pb-resources.com/bhm.html) section (which inspired this site!), and a plethora of resources, all wrapped in an aesthetic package with intuitive navigation that belies the sheer amount of information she has put together.

Alexis has amassed more than 86,000 followers on Instagram and 155,000 on TikTok where she regularly discusses her experiences as a Black Latina in computer science and helps spark interest in STEM among other young women, not to mention showing off her latest projects and [fashion sense](https://www.instagram.com/p/CH0kjSlHYlv/). Alexis didn’t originally view STEM as a male-dominated field or feel pushed out due to her gender. She credits that to her involvement in [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) and [Kode with Klossy](https://www.kodewithklossy.com/).
>When it comes to computer science stuff in particular, I am just so lucky in that I’ve done so many programs where I’ve been fully surrounded by girls. Those girls are all so passionate about computer science and engineering, and just to have people around me that are just as, if not more passionate than me about STEM, that can also relate to me on a very deep level on other things, has been so important in my life.<sup>[\[1\]](https://www.nyupb.com/about-1)
