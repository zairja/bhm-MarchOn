Yeshimabeit Milner is co-founder and executive director of [Data for Black Lives](https://d4bl.org/). Raised in Miami, Yeshimabeit committed herself to organizing after some friends of hers, attending a neighboring school, organized a nonviolent protest after a vice-principal put a 14-year-old student in a chokehold. Instead of being recognized for their initiative and leadership, their protest was met with violence. SWAT team units swept the school cafeteria. Over 30 students were injured from being beaten with police batons, or from their small frames being slammed against police cars by grown officers.

Yeshimabeit joined [Power U Center for Social Change](https://www.poweru.org/) as a high school senior and immersed herself in organizing because she knew that her life and the futures of countless other young people depended on it. More recently, Milner was a campaign manager at [Color of Change](https://colorofchange.org/) where she spearheaded several major national initiatives, including [OrganizeFor](https://organizefor.org/), the only online petition platform dedicated to building the political voice of Black people. She earned her BA in Africana Studies from Brown University and serves on the board of the Highlander Center in Tennessee.

As the founder of Data for Black Lives, her work has received much acclaim. Yeshimabeit is an Echoing Green Black Male Achievement Fellow, an Ashoka Fellow and joins the founders of Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street in the distinguished inaugural class of Roddenberry Foundation Fellows. In 2020, Yeshimabeit was honored as a Forbes 30 under 30 social entrepreneur.

Ultimately, Yeshimabeit is working to shepherd a cultural change in the world of data, away from exploitation and towards a new model where everyone working to benefit the community has access to data tools, rather than concentrated in the hands of people who already have money, power, and influence.

Major cultural and institutional shifts are required: to consider the impact new data-driven technologies will have on marginalized peoples; for data-driven research institutions to invest research dollars into initiatives that promote social justice; and for schools to teach data scientists and software engineers about the history of technologically-driven inequality. Yeshimabeit is creating new roles for these data scientists and software engineers, giving activists new tools for pursuing social change.
