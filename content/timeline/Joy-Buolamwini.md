As a creative science communicator, she has written op-eds on the impact of artificial intelligence for publications like TIME Magazine and New York Times. Joy received the Carol Jenkins award from the Women's Media Center for her contributions in explicating the coded gaze and its impact on gender equality. In her quest to tell stories that make daughters of diasporas dream and sons of privilege pause, her spoken word visual audit ["AI, Ain't I A Woman?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FejjAbwUqbA) which shows AI failures on the faces of iconic women like Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Serena Williams as well as the Coded Gaze short have been part of exhibitions ranging from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston to the Barbican Centre, UK.

## Organizations

In 2016, Buolamwini founded the [Algorithmic Justice League](https://www.ajl.org/) to create a world with more ethical and inclusive technology. Her TED Featured Talk on algorithmic bias has over 1 million views. Her MIT thesis methodology uncovered large racial and gender bias in AI services from companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon. Her research has been covered in over 40 countries, and as a renowned international speaker she has championed the need for algorithmic justice at the World Economic Forum and the United Nations.

She serves on the Global Tech Panel convened by the vice president of European Commission to advise world leaders and technology executives on ways to reduce the harms of AI. In late 2018 in partnership with the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology, Joy launched the [Safe Face Pledge](https://www.safefacepledge.org/), the first agreement of its kind that prohibits the lethal application of facial analysis and recognition technology.
