[Dr. J'Tia Hart](https://www.jtiaphd.com/)'s interest in a STEM career began on a trip while in Navy ROTC:

>I was out on a submarine, underwater, powered by nuclear power, and I was a little scared. I thought to myself, Who is the person that makes sure all of this works how it’s supposed to? And they said, ‘That’s a nuclear engineer.’ I just thought it was the coolest thing ever. I said, I want to be the person who is in charge of making sure that all of this technology is being used safely.

Dr. Hart earned her bachelor's of science in industrial engineering from Florida State University, followed by a master's and doctorate in nuclear engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research area spans energy economics, nonproliferation and modeling  nuclear systems. Hart has published academic articles and book chapters on unconventional reactors, the nuclear fuel cycle and international energy development.

Dr. Hart now resides in Chicago with her husband and two children where she works for the Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), a massive multidisciplinary science and engineering research center. Hart's role is a unique intersection of technical expertise and critical thinking, with her work receiving accolades from the last two presidential administrations.


Dr. Hart is also passionate about encouraging and facilitating participation of underrepresented groups (women, African-Americans, Native-Americans, Latinx) in STEM. She nurtures young adults through mentorship, speaking and outreach activities with organizations such as City Year Chicago, The Girl Scouts of America, Women in Science & Technology, American Nuclear Society, and the Society of Women Engineers.

## Organizations / Resources

As the Women in Science and Technology program initiator at ANL, Hart is pushing a more inclusive and modern approach to STEM to young Black & Brown girls. She wants to show them you can be in STEM and still be cool and versatile.

ANL offers female high school students an extraordinary opportunity to explore the world of STEM research at [Science Careers in Search of Women](https://www.anl.gov/hr/science-careers-in-search-of-women) on **Thursday, April 15, 2021**. The conference provides participants with the unique experience to explore their desired profession or area of interest through interaction with Argonne’s world-class women scientists and engineers. **Interested students must register online by Thursday, March 25, 2021 at 5:00 PM CST.**

The [Argonne African American Employee Resource Group](https://blogs.anl.gov/aaa-erg/scholarships/) also has programs and scholarhips for minority high school seniors who have an interest in STEM. The applicants must be US citizens and residents of the Chicago-land or surrounding areas and the deadline to apply is **March 31, 2021**.

Dr. Hart is also releasing a web series this week called [STEM Queens](https://www.facebook.com/RealSTEMQueens/). The 10-minute episodes will show the range and excellence of Black women in STEM by featuring a professional talking about herself, her career, and what she does for fun.

Last September, Dr. Hart was named an [IF/THEN ambassador](https://www.ifthenshecan.org/) by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, working to inspire talented young women to pursue careers in STEM.

>It’s really important for young women to see that you don’t have to look like Einstein to be in science and be successful. You can bring your whole beautiful, feminine self to STEM and be successful. At every point during my career and education, when I wanted to go a different way, I had a strong Black woman who was like ‘get your behind back in STEM.’ And that is exactly what I’m trying to be for the next generation of young ladies.

## Ways to Contribute

The AAA ERG and local DuPage County chapter of [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics](https://dupageactso.wildapricot.org/About) collaborate on programs to encourage high academic and cultural achievement among African-American high school students. DuPage County ACT-SO accepts [donations](https://dupageactso.wildapricot.org/Donate) and has volunteer opporutnities. Institutions may also [partner with the AAA ERG](https://blogs.anl.gov/aaa-erg/act-so/partners/).
